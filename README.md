Some information about the dataset:
[For more details, please consult the above paper]

1) Study_Number: Same as User Number. For each searcher/user who took part in the study, we have used unique numbers (Range: 1- 25).
   Each study/user has three tasks.
2) Utterance_Number: The utterances/dialogues between the user and the system. There are no utterance numbers for search actions performed by the system/agent.
3) Task_Order: Range 0-2, with 0 being the warm-up task, and 1 and 2 are the experimental tasks 1 and 2.
4) System_Number: Two values 0 and 1, with 0 being the baseline system (no explanations) and 1 being the experimental system (with explanations).
5) Action: Speech (when the user or the system talks) or Search (when the system searches).
6) Speaker: User or System who speaks.
7) Content: The dialogue or utterance (applicable only for Speech).
8) Duration: The length of each action measured in seconds.
9) Speech_Act: 12 categories (more details about the categories can be found in the paper, Section 4.3.1)
